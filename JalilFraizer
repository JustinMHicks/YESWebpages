Dont mess it up!!!!!
so hi future me and those smart enough to visit my site.
<p> So this is my notes website where i will discuss physics language and coding.</p>
 <h1> Physics</h1> 
 <p> Physics is the study of objects in motion</p>
 <p>Scalar vs. Vector</p>
    <p>Scalar: size + magnitude, Ex. mass, distance, speed, area, amount, volume, temperature, time, and length</p>
    <p>Vector: Size + direction, Ex. velocity, displacement, weight, acceleration, force</p>
    <pug35rydukasliu45guesfPhysics Word Bank</mark></h1> 
 <ol>
 <li> Acceleration/ Vector: the rate of change of velocity per unit of time  </li>
 <li> Speed/ Scalar: the rate at which someone or something is able to move or operate. </li>
 <li> Newton/ Vector: the SI unit of force. It is equal to the force that would give a mass of one kilogram an acceleration of one meter per second per second, and is equivalent to 100,000 dynes </li>
 <li> Force/ Vector: strength or energy as an attribute of physical action or movement. </li>
 <li> Distance/ Scalar: an amount of space between two things or people. </li>
 <li> Displacement/ Vector: the moving of something from its place or position.  </li>
 <li> Area/ Scalar:  the extent or measurement of a surface.  </li>
 <li> Mass/ Scalar:  a coherent, typically large body of matter with no definite shape.</li>
 <li> Velocity/ Vector:  a quantity having direction as well as magnitude, especially as determining the position of one point in space relative to another.  </li>
</ol>

 This is a very interesting and catchy but informational song about proper grammer.

 There are three treatments of cancer that can put cancer into remission 
 <ol>
 <li> Radiation</li>
 <li> Have the tumor surgically removed</li>
 <li> Kemo-therapy</li>
 </ol>

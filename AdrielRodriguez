<h1>MY NOTES FROM YES</h1>
<p>This is a website that is accessed for notes from the YES program so LISTEN UP OR IN YOUR CASE READ!</p>
<h2 style="color:blue">Math/physics</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A scalar quantity is the certain size of a quantity</li>
    <li>A vector quantity is the size and direction of a certain quantity a synonym for vector quantity is magnitude.</li>
    
</ul>
<h2 style="color:red">Examples of scalar quantities:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mass</li>
        <li>Distance</li>
        <li>Volume</li>
        <li>Time</li>
        <li>Speed</li>
        <li>Area</li>
        <li>Temperature</li>
        <li>Length</li>
        <li>Amount</li>
    </ol>
<h2 style="color:red">Example of vector quantities:</h2>
<ol><li>Velocity</li><li>Displacement</li><li>Acceleration</li><li><strong>Weight</strong></li><li><strong>Force</strong></li></ol>
<h2 style="color:yellow"><em>defenitions</em></h2>
<ul><LI><em>weight-the force that gravitation exerts upon a body, equal to the mass of the body times the local acceleration of gravity: commonly taken, in a region of constant gravitational acceleration, as a measure of mass.</em></LI><li><em>Force-a push or pull in any direction</em></li></ul>

<h2>Writing(this might be quick, seriously)</h2>
<p>ok, so the goal to good writing is defined simply translated as thought to speech to grammar then writing. this is called transitions from thought to speech is an example of transition</p>
<h4><em>subordinate conjunction</em></h4>
<p>If a subordinate conjunction is added to a sentence that is independent it then becomes a dependent clause.</p>

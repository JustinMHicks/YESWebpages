    <h1 style=font-size:30px;color:red;background-color:cyan><u>The Heart</u></h1>
        <p>The heart is a very crucial part of a human. Wanna know why? It's because it re-oxygenates and circulates blood throughout the body! Here you'll learn more about the heart.</p>
        <p>Veins and arteries are these tube-like stuctures that are called blood vessels. They both carrry blood, but in different directions. Veins carry blood to the heart and arteries carry blood to other body parts.</p>
       <p>All the veins bringing blood to the heart will eventually merge and create a major vein called the <u>Vena Cava</u>. The Vena Cava is connected to the heart and is connected to the right atria, one of the four chambers of the heart. The right atria will contract when it's full of blood and sends it to the next chamber through the tricuspid valve.</p>
       <p>valves in the heart control the direction of blood flow. The tricuspid valve is an <u>atrioventricular valve</u> and connects the right atria and the right ventricle(the next chamber). </p>
       <p>As stated earlier, the the next place that blood flows to is the right ventricle. The right ventricle sends blood to the lungs to be oxygenated through the pulmonary artery.</p>
       <p>The pulmonary artery is an artery connected to the heart with the pulmonic valve, a <u>semilunar valve</u>. After going through the lungs and being oxgenated, they travel through the pulmonary veins into the next heart chamber.</p>
       <p>The next chamber is the left atria, the first chamber to carry oxygenated blood, fresh from the lungs! The left atria sends blood through the bicuspid valve into the strongest and final chamber of the heart.</p>
       <p>The final chamber is the left ventricle (a.k.a the Arnold Schwarzenegger of the heart). The left ventricle is the strongest heart chamber and it really has to be, seeing as how it pumps blood through the entire body. After the final powerful contraction, blood travels through the aortic valve and aorta. After this, blood travells through the body and comes back throught veins leading to the heart, repeating the cycle.</p>
    <h1 style=font-size:30px;color:lightblue;background-color:darkblue><u><a name=Diabetes>Diabetes</a></u></h1>
        <p>Diabetes is a disease that involves Glucose, which is a simple sugar, and <u>insulin</u>, a hormone released by the pancreas to lower glucose levels. Diabetes occurs when your pancreas creates little to no insulin,which is type one diabetes,or, your body is unable to use insulin that is created, which is type two diabetes.</p>
        <p>What insulin exactly does is it causes cells to absorb glucose to turn into energy. When little to no insulin is created, there isn't much glucose being absorbed by your cells. When there is too much glucose in your bloodstream, the pancreas will make more insulin to make up for it. Overtime, your pancreas can't keep up with the amount of glucose there is and your cells become insulin resistant.</p>
        <p>When glucose is stuck in your bloodstream, it just stays in your bloodstream. When it stays for a while, the glucose hardens and sticks to the sides of your arteries. When too much of this hardened glucose accumulates in one place, it minimizes the amount of blood going to your muscles and other cells. When this happens, not all of your blood gets to cells that need oxygen and other nutrients, so you begin to lose energy. with this, your cells want want food and you eat more, but without exercise to get rid of glucose traveling around, you become obese, and are more prone to heart attacks and other health risks, such as heart failure and stroke.</p>
        <p>There are three major signs of diabetes. These are polyphagia, polyuria, and polydipsia.</p>
        <p>Polyphagia is basically increased hunger. This is because your cells aren't getting any of the glucose from the food you eat to make energy. If you were reading the passages before, you'd know insulin makes cells absorb the glucose in your blood. With diabetes, you don't have any insulin to make this happen, or your cells don't "listen" to the insulin and don't absorb any glucose. Since your cells aren't getting energy, they become hungry and so do you. Polyphagia in a diabetic is the body trying to get glucose inside of the cells to make energy(<u>ATP</u>). </p>
        <p>Polyuria is an increase of urination. The reason why this is happening is because the kidneys are trying to get rid of excess sugar. Normally, the kidneys would try to take in as much sugar as they can from fluids, but in the case of diabetics, there's already too much sugar in the bloodstream and that extra glucose is released as urine. Fun Fact: Urine samples were tasted to see if a person had diabetes. the extra glucose in the urine would make the urine taste unusually sweet.</p>
        <p>Polydipsia is an increased thirst. This is to compensate for the amount of water lost from polyuria.</p>
     <h2 style=font-size:30px;color:white;background-color:royalblue><u>Cancer</u></h2>
        <p>Cancer is a disease that involves cells at a very small scale. Your cells go under a process called mitosis, when a cell doubles everything and splits apart to create another cell with the exact same DNA. The rate of mitosis is controlled by a tumor supressor that slows down the rate of mitosis and the oncogene that does the opposite.</p>
        <p>When there is something wrong with the tumor supressor, it won't stop the oncogene from creating more and more cells. these cells also have the defective tumor supressor and will also continuously go under mitosis. When there are many of these cells in one place, it's a tumor. </p>
        <p>There are two types of cancer. One is benign and the other is malignant. Benign tumors are tumors that start in one place and don't move to other parts of your body. Malignant tumors are the opposite. Malignant tumors are tumors that can move throughout your body and are significantly more dangerous than benign tumors.</p>
        <p>There are several different way to get rid of cancer. It's actually put into remission, because cancer can come back if the patient is left unattended. Chemotherapy is when the the cancer patient is injected with chemicals to try and put the cancer into remission. Another way to get rid of cancer is with radiation therapy. Radiation therapy radiates the cancer to make the cancer cells die. This can also kill normal cells, so that's why some cancer patients who go under radiation therapy are bald, the cells that make up their hair are killed. The last way to put cancer into remission on this list is surgical removal. This is more effective on benign tumors because they are in a single area. Malignant tumors have to be remove in its early stages or else it will spread and there would be too many cancer cells too remove all at once. </p>
